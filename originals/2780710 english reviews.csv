Picked some random healing skill, and it was enough to boringly run in circles while dragging my mouse through enemy hordes. Grabbed some fruits for extra heals now and then, just to run in circles with even more gusto. Enemies’ attacks have this tiny delay, so if you run in circles, they can’t even land a hit, and there’s no contact damage. So, I ran in circles. Dodged a couple of AOE attacks on the boss with a quick dash — then back to running in circles. Picked skills at random since I’m a noob and clueless, but running in circles? Total meta. Wanna run in circles? This game’s for you. Otherwise, it’s so dull, even YouTube in the background can’t save it. If the game gets good after hours, I’m too lazy to waste 10 minutes per run yawning and mashing W-A-S-D in a loop."

Only has 3 characters with their trees not being that exciting and they take a while to start feeling unique. The grind for the runes and skills point is just boring..

It has potential and nice art but its not there yet imo.."

I greatly like that the bosses actually have mechanics.

Miss the level that the first demo had. Current levels seem bland.

Kind of enjoyed the level-up UI in the first demo more than current, but the mechanics changed to a board setup, so I can see why it changed.

White runes are very lack luster. Purple runes also seldom seem worth it. Stat runes are very great. Legendary runes seem worthless. Epic runes aren't worth the space. Really seems like the rune system should be reworked or re-balanced. Values being based more on the amount of space the rune takes up instead of Value Tiers. Value could still be tiered, but the value increase by tier seems lacking. This ends up being why the Stat runes are completely better than all the other runes, IMO.

Would be nice if I could toggle an auto-Dematerialize option for white runes \	 purple runes.

Recommend tagging dodge on the stat sheet with (MAX: 35%). It only tells you after you reach/exceed the max value. Would do this for every stat that doesn't have an obvious max (like crit chance or status effect chances).

Need a slight delay for inputs when the level up screen comes up, as I've mistakenly chosen skills because I was picking up runes off the ground. Would recommend just auto-collecting runes.

Would be nice if the game remembered what character I was using last time.

Would be nice if the game let me set to always show stats on the level-up rune board.

Also, it would be nice to be able to see my stats on the Warpaint board.

It would also be nice if when removing a rune from the Warpaint board that the selection would stay at that spot. Upon selecting a pattern, automatically put the cursor/selector where it could fit on the board, or move to default. Upon placing a pattern, move the cursor back to the previously selected pattern.

Rune bag might need a filter of some sort? Or mass Dematerialize option based on some criteria? Like if I could Dematerialize all rune that only have Tier 1 stats. Or all White rarity runes."

Great game, and I’m really excited to see future updates!

This is the first game that truly pulled me into trying out this genre. I played the demo a while back, and ever since, I couldn’t wait for its early access launch. Now that I’ve finally gotten to dive in, I can say I’m really enjoying the experience.

I love the art style, and the progression feels fun and rewarding. There’s still a lot left for me to explore—I haven’t played through all the maps or fully tried out every class yet, so there’s definitely more for me to discover.

One of the things I enjoy most is the ability system. I really like how abilities work—how you choose them, the way rarities affect them, and how they still cap out at some point to keep things balanced. Each choice you make while leveling them up feels impactful in every run, and I love the ability to combine them into ultimate versions, which adds a really satisfying layer to building your character.

The node system is another feature I appreciate a lot. It gives you even more ways to improve your build, and the variety of status effects, stats, and unique effects really adds depth. I hope to see even more of these in the future!

What I love most, though, is how the process of figuring out and working on my build actually makes me smile. There are so many different abilities, elements, and combinations to play around with, and I’m always excited to try something new and make it work. It’s a great feeling when a creative build idea clicks and ends up being super effective.

That said, since the game is still in development, I can already see an ""end"" in sight—for now. Currently, there are 4 out of the planned 9 maps available, and I genuinely can’t wait to play the rest as they release!

One small concern I have is with resource usage in the long run. Once you’ve unlocked every rune, it’s not entirely clear what to do with the leftover materials. I’d love to see some sort of infinite resource sink added in the future. Also, it would be great to have more options for increasing the Blood Sacrifice level for additional late-game depth.

I haven’t kept up with every development update, so some of these things might already be planned. But from my perspective as a player, that’s where I stand right now.

Overall, I’m having a great time with Asgards Fall, and I’m excited to see how it grows!"

I really enjoyed my runs of the game so far, though I had the feeling that there are only so many viable skills for dealing a lot of damage, which could get stale when grinding for the meta progression. 
What I noticed as well, when playing a specific upgrade is that attack speed is hard capped at 500% even though it showed next to it, that I reached 1700% in theory. I would really enjoy being free to try out combinations of skills and ""OP-Builds"" without being hard capped at some point.
My only other whish would be more achievements for specific actions, opposed to just ""kill x enemies"" (I am aware that at this stage of early access this is probably somewhere on a bucketlist and will be added later. Cool to have achievements this early already)"

[b]First of all, this is an incredible game![/b] I simply couldn't stop playing. I spent several hours straight completely immersed in the game. In my opinion, it has huge potential to become even better.
[hr][/hr]
[h1][b]Highlights:[/b][/h1]
[list]
	[*][b]Addictive and smooth gameplay:[/b] The core loop is already very well-polished and fun to play. The battles are intense and satisfying.
	[*][b]Innovation:[/b] I really like the Web of Wyrd feature.
	[*][b]Great performance:[/b] The game runs super smoothly.
	[*][b]Beautiful visuals:[/b] The pixel art is gorgeous! (Well, I'm biased, because I love pixel art lol.)
	[*][b]Immersive soundtrack:[/b] It fits perfectly with the game’s atmosphere.
	[*][b]Good variety of builds: [/b]Even in Early Access, there are tons of combinations of powers and runes you can experiment with. It’s fun to discover new synergies mid-run.
[/list]
[hr][/hr]
[h1][b]What I’d love to see in the future:[/b][/h1]
[h2][b][u]New Content[/u][/b][/h2]
[list]
	[*][b]New achievements[/b] (but please, not super grindy or frustrating ones): So far, the achievements are great, nothing to complain about. I just hope the new ones maintain the same quality and don’t end up being boring or rage-inducing to complete, like in many other games.
	[*][b]New playable characters and maps.[/b]
	[*][b]New powers and abilities.[/b]
	[*][b]New game modes: 1.[/b] [b]Survival mode[/b] with no time limit; [b]2.[/b] [b]Local and online co-op[/b] to play with friends; [b]3. [/b] [b]Faster-paced maps[/b] with shorter time limits and more enemies (e.g., a 12-minute map with a mini-boss at 6 minutes and a main boss at 12), etc.
[/list]
[h2][b][u]Gameplay / Runs Improvements[/u][/b][/h2]
[list]
	[*][b]Better visibility of enemy projectiles[/b], especially homing ones, because it becomes really hard to see them with certain builds/abilities.
	[*][b]Show character's main weapon info during battle:[/b] Currently, we can only see the abilities we chose in the run, but not the stats or details of our starting weapon from our main character.
	[*][b]Option to view total damage in real-time[/b], not just at the end of a run. This would help evaluate which abilities are more effective while the run is still going.
	[*][b]Show ability levels and upgrades at the end of a run:[/b] For better planning, we could hover over each skill to see its max level reached, upgrade details, and total damage dealt.
	[*][b]Fusion/Special abilities are not included in the total damage stats: [/b]This should be fixed so the numbers reflect everything.
	[*][b]Possibility to get two ability fusions per run[/b], instead of just one.
	[*][b]Fusion system improvements[/b]: As it is, some unique abilities feel stronger than the fused ones. Fusions should feel like real upgrades and worth aiming for.
	[*][b]Allow fused abilities to level up further: [/b]Sometimes, unique non-fused abilities end up being stronger than the fused versions.
	[*][b]More fusion combinations between abilities: [/b]Some abilities don’t have any fusion options, so I often skip them entirely.
	[*][b]Option to ban or block certain abilities[/b] [b]from appearing during a run:[/b] For build control and avoiding unwanted combos this would be wonderful.
	[*][b]Better balancing between abilities/knots drop chances: [/b]some abilities show up way more than others, at least it seems like.
	[*][b]More in-game items during runs[/b], beyond just apples and magnets (small utility or surprise items could add more depth).
[/list]
[h2][b][u]Main Place Improvements[/u][/b][/h2]
[h3][b]🔥 Bonfire:[/b][/h3]
[list]
	[*][b]Show more detailed stats of each character’s main weapon[/b], such as damage, cooldown, pierce, quantity, etc.

	[*][b]Better inventory organization: [/b]Ability to [b]sort or sell runes[/b] by type, shape, or rarity.
[/list]
[h3][b]🎨 Warpaint:[/b][/h3]
[list]
	[*][b]Improve Warpaint UI and loadout management: 1.[/b] Option to [b]upgrade Warpaint slots[/b]; [b]2. Custom Warpaint per character[/b]: Maybe each character could have their own dedicated loadout slots, or at least, just having more loadout slots in general would be great.
	[*][b]Rune System Improvements[/b]: [b]1. Create custom runes: [/b]more expensive, but with customizable shape and stat odds; [b]2. Upgrade existing runes: [/b]e.g., you like a common one (white) and want to improve it to the next level (purple or yellow) or add new stats; [b]3. Reroll stats of runes[/b]; [b]4. Add experience-boosting runes[/b]: Runes that increase either [b]battle XP[/b] (to level up faster during a run) or [b]character XP[/b] (to level up the character outside of battle).
[/list]
[h3][b]📚 Compendium:[/b][/h3]
[list]
	[*]Add a [b]""Skill Discovery Wiki""[/b] to track all abilities you've unlocked, maybe as an extra tool beyond the current compendium. And they could be sorted out by type, short distance, long distance, aura, ice, ignite, physical, etc.
	[*]Add a [b]""Skill Discovery Wiki""[/b] to track all the abilities you've unlocked, maybe as a more detailed tool alongside the existing compendium. It could include filters or sorting options by [b]type[/b] (e.g., melee, ranged, aura, ice, ignite, physical damage, etc.), making it easier to study and plan future builds.
[/list]
[h3][b]🕸️ Web of Wyrd:[/b][/h3]
[list]
	[*]Add a [b]“remove knot”[/b] option to cancel a placed knot.
	[*]Add a [b]“joker knot”: [/b]a rare node where you can choose the knot type (power, echo, fate, etc.).
	[*]Add [b]keyboard-only shortcuts[/b] for players using keyboard + mouse (no controller), so rerolling or navigation doesn’t require mouse clicks.
[/list]
[h2][b][u]General Improvements[/u][/b][/h2]
[list]
	[*][b]Better tutorial: 1.[/b] Explain all controls and mechanics more clearly, for example, mention the [b]Tab[/b] key to view stats during battle, and clarify the functions of each location on the main map; [b]2.[/b] Add an option to [b]replay the tutorial[/b], in case we need a refresher after taking a break from the game; [b]3.[/b] Include a tutorial for the main areas of the hub: [b]Warpaint, Inventory, Compendium[/b], etc.
	[*][b]UI improvements[/b] and more accessibility options
	[*][b]Add a run history feature[/b]: It would be great to see past builds and run data, super useful to remember the abilities and synergies we used before.
	[*][b]Fix Portuguese translation issues[/b]: I noticed a few small mistakes, and some parts are still untranslated (showing in English instead of Portuguese).
	[*][b]Fix small bugs.[/b]

[h1][b]Final Thoughts[/b][/h1]
[b]I love the game and I’m confident this game has a very bright future! [/b]The devs are on the right track, and even in this early stage, Asgard’s Fall - Viking Survivors is already a blast to play. With the right updates, I'm sure it has the potential to become one of the greatest games of the genre out there.

- Addition to the previous: Right now I find it very hard to gauge which path or ability to push during a run. Sometimes telling which one is dealing the most damage currently is hard to tell. Maybe any system for this?

- Regarding runes: Cool system! Would be awesome to have the warpaint saved PER character and even better a loadout functionality would be amazing!

- Visual clarity: I absolutely adore the graphics. However at some point when there are too many enemies on screen and a lot of abilities are triggering, it is really hard to see where my character is resulting in taking damage sometimes.

[i]TL;DR: Solid start with a beautiful pixel world and fun systems — excited for future updates![/i]

As someone who's played a ton of roguelikes — from [i]Hades[/i] to [i]Dead Cells[/i] to [i]Vampire Survivors[/i] — I came into [i]Asgard's Fall - Viking Survivors[/i] with high hopes. And honestly? It’s already shaping up to be a standout in the genre.

[hr]

[h1]What I’m Loving[/h1]

[b]Pixel Artstyle[/b]
The pixel art is beautifully done. Animations are smooth, environments are detailed, and the combat effects are crisp without becoming visual noise. It nails the Viking aesthetic while still being clear and readable mid-chaos.

[b]Web of Wyrd[/b]
This system is a clever way of handling mid-run choices. Picking your path across the web feels meaningful, and it adds a solid layer of strategy when choosing how to grow your build during a run.

[b]Warpaints[/b]
Love the way Warpaints affect your passive abilities. They give a nice sense of customization and experimentation without overwhelming you. When the right combination hits, it feels fantastic.

[b]Character Leveling[/b]
Progression between runs helps keep things feeling rewarding. I like being able to slowly build up power and invest in my favorite characters.

[hr]

[h1]Suggestions & Wishlist[/h1]

[b]1. Warpaint Loadouts[/b]
Allowing players to save and switch between Warpaint loadouts would be a great quality-of-life improvement, especially for testing and refining builds.

[b]2. Warpaint Layout Variants[/b]
Currently the grid system is fine, but having alternative layouts would deepen the strategy and keep builds more interesting run-to-run.

[b]3. Web of Wyrd Variants[/b]
Different or randomized layouts for the Web of Wyrd would add variety and increase replay value.

[b]4. Banish / Lock Abilities and Knots[/b]
A way to [i]banish[/i] unwanted upgrades or [i]lock in[/i] favored ones (either during or before a run) would give players more control over their builds and reduce RNG frustration.

[b]5. More Diverse Characters[/b]
Would love to see additional characters with unique mechanics or quirks that drastically change gameplay. Something a little more experimental could really shake things up.

[b]6. Upcycling Warpaints[/b]
Being able to combine or upgrade lower-tier Warpaints into higher-tier versions would give a great sense of progression and clean up inventory bloat.

[b]7. Endless Mode[/b]
Please consider adding an endless or survival mode. Being able to see how far a build can go without a cap would be a fantastic addition for fans of longevity and pushing limits.

[b]8. Meta Progression Enhancements[/b]
Stat upgrades, more detailed character enhancements, and systems like ability banishing/locking could really enrich the long-term progression loop.

[hr]

[h1]Final Thoughts[/h1]

[i]Asgard’s Fall[/i] is already off to a strong start. It’s fast-paced, visually striking, and layered with interesting systems that feel both accessible and deep. While it’s not feature-complete yet, what’s already there is very promising — and the game clearly has the potential to become a genre favorite.

[b]Verdict:[/b]
If you love roguelikes, pixel art, and Viking chaos — this one’s well worth your time.
Devs seem engaged and thoughtful, which bodes well for future updates.

Very cool idea and concept but boy does this need work. Experiencing awful warpaint bugs where they just vanish and unique ones are lost for the entire save. Awful control layout for controller and not letting us change keybinds is certainly... a choice. Certain enemy types feel unrewarding or downright impossible to fight.

Everyone was harping on the fact progress is grindy? But is that not the point of this game genre?

A lot of the enemies have similar attacks but just look a little different, which really isn't a bad thing and I guess it's also because this game is in Early Access.
I like that there's a reason to farm the maps multiple times instead of just finishing them once and then moving on to the next one.

https://youtu.be/-F90W-lJL1A

I enjoyed this game a lot! I thought the scope for it being Early Access seems a lot. I don't know if the game is SUPPOSE to be this hard but goddamn is this brutal. My first run lasted a good 3 minutes. Your hitbox seems massive and its definitely hard to telegraph just when or how you're getting hit.

The randomness is too brutal und punishing, while the meta progression to soft it up is locked behind content thats too far away. You have to struggle to the mid- and endgame without meaningfull progression in order to unlock basic upgrades. Resulting in many aborted runs. This is not worth my time.
Since you have only a limited amount of rune slots per run, the worth of runes and stats they provide have to be evaluated differently compared to other horde survival games, where you can get unlimited upgrades. But this is not the case, rendering many runes useless or even punishing if you get forced to choose them."

2780710,1744491435,76561197996568942,english,1816,192610577,true,false,"So I think there's a lot of things this game does not just right, but also new for the survival genre to my knowledge. I found myself impressed with the degree of variety between the different classes, and the potential they showed for implementing unique mechanics for core gameplay aspects like survival (ok, it was just the Seer that impressed me with its alternative of potions to golden apples.) But bottom line I think what I enjoyed the most here was the alternative it posited to just the standards of contact damage - this is a difference you can REALLY feel with the default warrior class, because most of the time with him you're actually encouraged to run [i]through[/i] your attackers to deal damage and avoid their attacks. Not to mention, there's ton of attack variety here as well, so that's not always the approach you're encouraged to take for beating enemies. Considering how Stage 3 goes, that aspect only becomes more salient (still trying to figure out which enemy there does the fire walls... Or the SKULL STAMPEDES) 
It's a very refreshing change of pace versus most other auto-survival games where usually characters of the melee playstyle just go all-in on durability or counterattacks - no, the warrior can be a melee glass-cannon, and [i]flourish[/i] at it.

Now, here's where my confidence falters. I'm going to be careful here - knowing the game is still in early-access and that things are subject to improvement - This is applying to its traits that are entwined with its design choices:

First, meta-progression aspects. When it comes down to it unlocking the Huntress comes down to pure chance when it comes to finding the right knots, and when you unlock new characters, the most drastic upgrades that allow you to use the new characters you get (the actual ""levels"" at the stone of sedir) still need to be ground out - usually meaning that you have to pause progress towards conquering the newest level you have and usually return to Midgard for them to have a chance. For that matter, why is body paint shared between all characters in general, when it's clear that each class favors building towards a specific selection of weapons or attacks?
There's some clumsiness to handling the game's UI - it took me a few seconds to realize spacebar is dash and there's no place it lets the player remap controls (yet). It's also a game that has aspects of inventory management as you collect runes, and there's seemingly no way to quickly recycle swaths of them - you have to individually RMB and confirm each one with mouse. This I'm aware is something that should naturally be fixed with more production, but some expectations such as having availability to my active effects during a run (from knots) or even remembering the forged weapon combos on-hand are basic QoL features I would've hoped for.
The presence of the inventory and runes ties into the last, and I think most important issue I have: [b]The Quality System[/b]. Ironically I think that it's least problematic with the rune-drop system. It's MOST problematic for when you level up, and in a way it ends up removing the agency that other rougelite survival games use rerolls for in this case. Because sometimes, a roll will generate an objectively inferior set of upgrades or knots of ""common"" quality. This is most dire with knots, because the aspects of knot positioning alongside randomly-generated values means you can end up rolling POWERFUL multipliers or traits, but then don't have the correct positioning on the grid to actually make it work - when one of the unlock conditions is to get a 500% attack speed increase, this simply becomes frustrating to deal with.
There's also some stability issues I ran into with the game freezing for extended periods of time - this could be excusable if not for the fact that after the game resumes, all my weapons go on an endless cooldown and I become unable to attack.

Every other thing I have issue with is minor - hard-to-read symbols due to the low-res style, some lack of variety with weapons or sound design, but these are all things that are straightforward to improve with more development. The game has some strong legs, supporting a solid core of gameplay - but it needs to tread carefully with them given the direction it takes with meta-progression and randomization."

Extra Enemy Damage Bug: Extra enemy damage seems to also increase the damage taken from abilities like Blood Pact. It feels like all damage gets doubled instead of just enemy damage — not sure if that’s intentional or a bug.

Revive Ability Clarity: The revive ability either isn’t working correctly or needs a clearer indicator when it’s been used.

Weapon Ability Level Bug: Sometimes, weapon ability levels seem to reset or rollback. For example, I upgraded my Ballistics/Hammers from level 4 to 9, but then lost the upgrades and found them back at level 4 the next time I entered the shop. I can’t recreate this consistently, and while there’s a chance I’m misremembering, it has happened so many times that it feels unlikely. Could also be an issue on my end, but I wanted to flag it just in case.

Quality of Life Improvements:
Item Placement on Purchase: When you buy a new node/item, you should be able to move it — at least during the same turn — in case you accidentally place it in the wrong spot.

Knot of Echo vs Knot of Fade: Knot of Echo should give points toward Knot of Fade (personal opinion). Currently, using Knots of Echo often ruins the web since you can’t place a Knot of Fade next to them due to lack of available points.

Knot of Power Bonus: Maybe there could be a small bonus when giving a Knot of Power more energy than needed to activate it — though this might make the game too easy and would need proper balancing.

Weapon Balance: Some weapons feel much stronger than others, making many runs feel the same. Balancing them a bit would encourage more variety and experimentation. Not saying every weapon needs to be equal — just more viable across the board. (Also possible I’m not using some of the weaker weapons correctly — open to correction here.)

Seer Character Balance: Specifically in Blood Sacrifice runs, the Seer struggles early game when using extra enemies to fill the vessel — there’s just not enough AoE to handle the enemy swarm. Maybe his poison could leave a puddle that damages enemies who walk through it, adding more early-game control.

Bloodpoint Rewards from Debuffs: The bloodpoints (not sure if that’s the correct term) you get from debuffs in the vessel don’t always feel balanced. For example, things like reduced level-up choices or Valhalla mode feel much harder but don’t give enough points to make them worthwhile.

Rune System Improvements:
Rune Placement & Overview: Placing or moving runes from your inventory is really clunky. It’d be great to have an overview of all rune effects combined, and a smoother interface for managing them.

Rune Selling: Selling runes feels slow and tedious. A quick-sell option (e.g., sell all runes below a certain grade or without a specific stat) would be a huge help.

Rune Storage: A separate storage for runes you want to save for specific builds (but aren’t using currently) would help prevent accidental selling.

Rune Loadouts: Being able to save rune loadouts for different characters or builds would make switching setups way easier and less frustrating.

UI/UX Tweaks:
Shop Reroll Button: The reroll button is too close to the items in the shop. I’ve accidentally clicked it multiple times instead of buying an item — might just be me, but it doesn’t feel intuitive.

Custom Keybindings: It would be great to have customizable keybindings. For example, opening the inventory with the ""I"" key is pretty uncomfortable — it’s far from other commonly used keys.

Compendium Info: In the Compendium, it’s hard to tell which abilities are needed for combos. Just showing the name when hovering over them (after they’re unlocked) would solve this.

I hope you take this as constructive feedback and not as criticism of the game itself. I know it’s still in early access, and I really enjoy it overall. I’m excited to see what new characters, worlds, and updates are coming in the future!

It might get really good with updates that fix some issues, but that heavily relies on the dev taking the right decisions from now on and is  [b]not guaranteed [/b], so I can not recommend the game for now. I will shortly list the good before adressing the bad :

[b]GOOD [/b] : 
> Everything surface level is great (the designs, the animations, the colours, the sound effects, the music, ... the first impression is really good

[b]BAD [/b] :

> QoL features and user friendliness. Here are some examples :

1) can't rebind keys (if you don't have a controller and play on an AZERTY for example ... annoying)
2) making the stats lists appear is not intuitive. When you press pause (escape on KB or start on controllers), the pause menu doesn't show the list of stats and what they do. That is done by a separate key (TAB on KB, select on controllers) but the game never gives you that information, leading some new players to just completely ignore the existence of the stat list until they research on the steam forums how to make it appear. There's also NO REASON for the stat list to not be on the pause menu, as there's two huge empty space on each side of the screen, and that's the most intuitive place to put it for the players to see.
3) some stats are just impossible to understand. Take ignite for example. It deals fire damage over time. Ok, but then what ? Does it scale with the stat ""Damage"" ? Does it stack ? If yes, whats the stack limit ? What's the base damage number for it ? And its the same for Bleed. Gauging the efficiency of these is needlessly annoying, just because the game doesn't give us that information to work with.
4) the inventory is a joke. You can't move items in it to organise it by hand. You can't filter it using filter types such as rarity, affixes tiers, etc. If you want to put a rune in your puzzle (that is the way to get more passive stats) the inventory is not visible ANYWHERE. Like it could be one of the side menus, allowing easy drag and drops etc ... but no, you have to open the inventory separately (and the button for that is NOT visible at that point), click on the rune, then place it. Meaning you can never see both the puzzle AND the inventory at the same time. Like, come on, just have the inventory on the side menu with the unlockable on the right as one of those windows, there's no reason to complicate players' life like that.
5) Pausing usually allows you to see what spells you picked so far and what they do ... EXCEPT when picking a new one during a level up. Like ... WHY ??? That's literally the moment we would like to check what we already to have, to compare the new skills to our build and see if it fits. 
6) As far as I can tell, you can't have several ""build"" pages. Meaning, if I want to have one rune page for physical builds, one for trap build, etc etc ... I can't ? Or is it a feature that exist but is weirdly hidden ? Does it mean i have to reassemble my rune puzzle everytime I wanna go for another build ?

> Stats :
1) The stats themselves are just badly designed. As someone else said in the reviews, the only defensive stat that matter is movement speed. In early game, like in the first couple of hours, maybe you can fiddle with health regen and hp ... but it quickly becomes completely irrelevant.
2) The stats are not balanced. The rarity sometimes doesn't even matter. I've already dropped an Epic Knot of Attack speed AND a Legendary Knot of Attack speed with the EXACT SAME VALUES (16%). Like ... huh ??? Why would you even do that ? 
3) The stats are not balanced (2). I believe there is math issues here (correct me if im wrong). A Knot of Crit chance for example will always be bad compared to a Knot of Increased x damage. For a similar investment to make crit worth it, the same investment in damage and attack speed will always prevail. The consequences of that is that the game isn't that flexible, and not that many stats are worth it. When the game forces you to go on something else than ideal, you can really feel that you're working with bad stats (crit chance, health regen, armore, hp, dodge)
4) The runes ... oh my god the runes. I've dropped like a dozen of ""Legendary runes"" (yellow ones) that are supposed to be super rare and super good ... only to discard them all. They're all filled with useless T1 affixes. None of them were usable. That's due to the low tier it rolled every single time, aswell as the number of valuable stats being quite small compared to all the stats available in the game. I play with 20 to 30 difficulty level (sacrifice level ? idk), and I haven't felt the difference in loot. Sure there might be slightly more legendary runes dropping ... but whats the point if they're all useless ?

Conclusion : 

Those were the main issues I have with the game, there's other minor ones but these are the most urgent to address in my opinion. I think there's potential for a really, really great game. Once again, everything on the surface looks good. But we really need tighter systems, more QoL features and user friendliness. We need that more than ""more content"" or ""more things to do"". We need the ""things"" to be more balanced, for the stats to matter more, for the loot to feel more rewarding, etc etc. Good job dev for the things you've done so far, I'm sure this game can be a banger, but for now I'll have to wait a few updates before I return on it and eventually recommend it to other people."

Pros: 
-Fun skill systems, the warpaint is a great idea for a modular system
-Weapons feel good, with a few having interesting mechanics
-The art style is easy on the eyes, making it a good game to relax with
-The Wyrd web system presents a minigame to your skill selection, which is a great idea

Cons:
-The levels are a bit overtuned, you rarely improve in power at the same rate as the stage difficulty. This is made worse by significant RNG for the stronger abilities
-Warpaint is highly randomized, without a real way to narrow down a build. This will lead to a lot of grinding for a specific build
-Enough weapons, not enough characters. Weapons don't have great passives, I've only seen one base weapon with any healing. Weapons need cool passives and only a few have them

Badly needs cloud saves however - I honestly didn't even realize that wasn't a thing for every game since it's been so long since I came across a game without it.

Speaking of the Steam Deck, it runs well, but would benefit from having a 16:10 aspect ratio option - and making all the fonts larger - heck on my desktop it would benefit from slightly larger fonts (they're not too small to read or anything, but would just benefit from being a bit larger). Also the music is mid - but I generally listen to podcasts or audiobooks while playing, so it's not a big deal to me - but Vampire Survivors it is not when it comes to music.

Now even though there isnt much ""new"" in this game when compared to others the new things like Web of Wyrd, Warpaints and twitch extension have been made exceptionally well and for the price the game has released there is a ton of stuff in terms of content as abilities and worlds.

The game is fluid and polished well apart from few things here and there like runes dissapearing from warpaints or the occasional damage taken outside of the hitbox.
The meta progression is alright ive seen better but also seen much worse.

2780710,1744283257,76561198035773191,english,470,192422008,false,false,"While this game certainly has promise, at the moment I can't recommend it.

Progress is incredibly slow, you can go multiple failed runs without gaining enough experience to add a single point into your chosen character's passive boosts. The warpaint system is a potentially interesting upgrade system that is borderline impossible to engage with because the symbols you add to your warpaint are gated behind random drops from increasingly more difficult maps, which you can only access by completing the previous maps. These two issues combine to create a frustrating experience where you feel as if you plug hours into the game without making any tangible progress.  

There are also a lot of pointless stats or upgrades. There is absolutely no reason to boost your armor, health, regen or dodge chance - the only ""defensive"" stat that matters is movement speed. If you haven't gotten some significant movement speed buffs by the second or third minute of your run, you might as well abandon it because you have a 0% chance of surviving. The only viable way to deal with the insane number of enemies that spawn is to simply be fast enough to run through the danger zone of their attacks before they can hit you. There is no other pathway to victory.

Danger zone indicators are another point of frustration - specifically on the third map. One of the environmental hazards of the third map is blobs of lava that fall onto the battlefield, creating zones that severely damage your character if you touch them. While the indicator for these blobs is a perfect circle, the resulting damage zone is an entirely different shape that almost always exceeds the limits of the zone indicator, meaning that even if you manage to skirt out of the way before the blobs hit the ground, you're liable to take damage regardless because the indicator wasn't accurate.

Weapons are currently very unbalanced. There are a small handful that I would consider ""good,"" but the majority offer so little - the valkyries that randomly fly across the screen deal little damage and have a tendency to hit 0 enemies, the molten lava ball that supposedly leaves a trail of fire just straight up doesn't do that, the lightning snake that randomly appears has a very small AoE and does very little damage, etc. It feels like certain attacks were added to meet a quota rather than adding anything useful or new to the attack pool.

Weapon evolutions are quite a let down as well, there are only a small number of selectable skills that can actually evolve, and when they do evolve all they really give you is one more attack. There are no interesting or unique effects unlocked by these evolutions.

I strongly suggest waiting before buying into this one. It feels very undercooked atm."

Will give it a positive review for now because of how fun it is and that they fixed manual aiming from the demo.  The things they need to address still are the following based on my experience playing extensively on day 1.

1) Runes disappearing from your warpaint (where you socket them in).  When this happens to stat runes,  you can only have 3/3 socketed in and the game still counts them even though they're not there.  Takes a lot fiddling with the mouse and KB to fix (can't be done with controller).

2) Controls on controller are janky.  There are also buttons that serve no purpose mapped to R3 (stick click), which you'll hit by accident and pause the action over and over again.  It bring up the rune backpack, but you can't change out runes during the round...so why is this even there to begin with?  If it needs to be there, put it under the pause menu or another tab of an existing screen.  There's also no mouse over tool tip info in places where it should be, either for M&KB or controller.

3) I'm convinced there's some weighting going on here with the blood sacrifice level (aka - map power level).  As you beat maps and progress to the next one, the rarity of upgrades and node drops will basically vanish unless you bump up the difficulty manually by increasing the blood sacrifice level by at least 1 level.  If you don't move it up, you'll end up getting mostly all white upgrades, making a lot harder to progress.  So be careful you don't beat a map while it's set too high until they do something about this.  Currently you have to increase the difficulty by at least 1 if you want to see any blue, purple or legendary drops.  You'll barely get any if you don't.  And the game becomes easier by increasing the difficulty the way it is, so this really doesn't make any sense.

The game also semi-froze on me once after beating the lava map, but I'm sure they'll fix this pretty quickly.  Basically I couldn't move no matter what input method I used...I think this might tied to the runes issue I listed above.  

The devs did also push a patch out during prime time gaming hours on launch day, which crashed the game while playing mid round on me, so they should also really be scheduling their patches for people to add in when they're ready.  Hopefully this was just an oversight and they'll handle these better going forward.

Otherwise it's a fun game and seems to have a ton of content."

If a run is on the shorter side, you receive such a tiny amount of experience that it takes several (unsuccessful) attempts just to level up once.

If you played nordic ashes it's a bit like it but where nordic ashes feels floaty and weighty this feels snappy and light. 

The Upgrade Mechanic to build a board during the run which has some depth to it, the fact that you use the XP to collect to then reroll and that the reroll always starts at a low price makes each run really fun and enganging.

I'm impressed by how much there is to do here for something that just launched in early access. This is a more challenging survivors-like than others I've played, so even veterans of the genre should find the difficulty to pose a challenge. I enjoyed all of the different upgrade systems and the strategy that goes into each of these. Naturally with early access comes room for improvement. That's still the case here but this is a great start and a lot of fun even for a day 1 early access release.

 For now, there are a few things I miss, for example, not being able to see your stats in the menu or run, and it would be nice to also see the abilities and their stats during a run to make the game more transparent and easier to plan builds.
I would also like to see the names of the abilities in the compendium (for example, when hovering over it) because at the beginning I can't remember all the symbols for the combinations. 
Another thing that can be improved is the movement with a controller. I can't exactly pinpoint what it is, but it feels like the character is kind of snapping to the x and y axes when moving, making the movement a little unpredictable and weird.

has nice concepts and mechanics, but lacks content.

I'll drop it for now since I cannot enjoy EA games anymore, it's just so tedious to hop into barely fundamentally finished games, get a sweet piece of cake and then having to wait for like 2-3 years until the content really sets in.

Nice balance, nice feeling, buttery smooth control.

Love it!

This game has been 3 years coming for me, So excited to finally see it release so that others may have enjoyed the little man shredder as much as I have."

Definitely one of the best roguelikes out there. The web mechanic of the talent tree is something I've never seen before in a game of this genre, which makes each round uniquely customizable. Combined with the meta progression and the rune system, it makes the heart of every survivor-like player beat faster. For hours, many hours. Too many hours...maybe."

If you like bullet-hell games or survivor-likes, you should definitely give it a try."
