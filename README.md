## Usage

1. Create a .env file and add your DeepL API key:

```env
DEEPL_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

2. Run the script:

``` bash
python translate_reviews.py
```

3. Enter a valid Steam App ID (e.g., 730 for CS:GO)

4. Choose how many reviews to fetch (all or a number)

5. Decide whether to translate and/or save the result

6. A .csv file will be saved in the /translations/ folder (if selected)

7. A logfile (translation_log.txt) will track your session

The translated files will be saved into the translations/ folder.
A detailed log file (translation_log.txt) will also be generated automatically.
